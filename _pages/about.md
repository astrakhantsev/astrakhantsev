I am a research fellow at [ISP RAS](http://www.ispras.ru/en/) working on natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and related topics, see [my papers](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=hn1AfAYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [PhD thesis](http://www.ispras.ru/en/publications/2015/methods_and_software_for_terminology_extraction_from_domain_specific_text_collection/). 

A significant part of my work time (as well as of any other programmer, especially in R&D) and a nonzero part of my spare time (as well as of any other programmer, especially not in R&D) relate to researches of one kind or another: find state-of-the-art method for some problem, choose a library, tune an algorithm or a tool for specific task and so on -- those activities that are too practical to be published in a paper and too theoretical to be open-sourced at github.

From these findings, I try to describe the most useful and (or at least or) interesting ones in this blog.
