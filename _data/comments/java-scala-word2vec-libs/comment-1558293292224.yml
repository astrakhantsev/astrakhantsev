  Hi Nikita, I just tried using word2vec scala with the spanish fast text
  embeddings from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html, and it seems
  the model is not loaded properly. I can't tell what format the vectors are
  supposed to have from looking at the code. Have you ever come across this
  problem. Any advice would be much appreciated.
